First, I was charged €19.99 three times on March 15th instead of once. Second, there's an unexplained fee of €5.99 labeled \"service charge\" that I never authorized. Third, my annual discount seems to have disappeared without notice.\nThis is causing significant stress and I need these billing errors corrected immediately. I've been a loyal customer for 4 years and this is completely unacceptable.\nPlease provide a detailed explanation and full refund of incorrect charges totaling €45.97.\nFrustrated and disappointed,\nRobert Thompson",

    "email": "Subject: Defective product received - immediate replacement needed\nHi Customer Service,\nI received my order yesterday and I'm extremely disappointed. The wireless headphones I ordered have a crackling sound in the left ear and the charging case doesn't close properly. This is clearly a manufacturing defect.\nI paid €89.99 for a premium product and received something that's completely unusable. I need a replacement sent immediately or I want a full refund.\nThis is very frustrating as I needed these for an important business trip next week.\nUnhappy customer,\nMark Rodriguez",
